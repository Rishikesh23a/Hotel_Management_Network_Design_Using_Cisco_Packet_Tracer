<h2>📌 Project Overview</h2>

This project focuses on designing a secure and scalable network for a Hotel Management System using Cisco Packet Tracer.
The network is built using VLANs, routers, switches, wireless access points, servers, CCTV systems, and cyber-security tools.

The design ensures:

✔ Secure guest & staff connectivity
✔ Separation of hotel management systems from guest traffic
✔ Network protection using encryption, ACLs, firewalls & authentication
✔ Reliable, high-performance communication across all hotel departments
